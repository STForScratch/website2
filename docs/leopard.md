# Update to "Open Project as Javascript"

> **Note**
> These new changes will NOT break or affect your project in any way, and your project remains safe, as does your Scratch account.

The Scratch Team has recently disabled the ability to view unshared projects. "Open Project as Javascript" used the ability to view unshared projects, that way it could convert them to Javascript.

Now, the Scratch Team requires "project tokens" to be able to view projects. For shared projects, the token is public. For unshared projects, only the owner can view the token.

This new update, unfortunately, doesn't allow "Open Project as Javascript" to work correctly. The feature will likely be removed in the next ScratchTools version, in an effort to speed up our website and the ScratchTools extension.
